To build the DKG program

Make sure this "siggy" directory has a sibling directory/project "csprng".

( cd build/keygen && go build )
( cd build/main && go build )

Start two instances of main together (under a second or two apart):

terminal 1:
cd run
./main config.out test_keys/public/ test_keys/h1_secret/ 3

terminal 2:
same but say h2_secret instead of h1_secret

Each instance of main will be running some number of guests.
You'll see the terminal print out that many "certified: true" messages.
When both terminal have done that, you can end the programs with Ctrl-C.

----
Hints for if you want to specify your own configuration (config.out),
- generate as many keypairs as you want by doing "cd run && ./keygen"
- specify hosts and the members local to those hosts in run/config.in
  - the h1, h2 labels are meaningless at present
- generate config.out from config.in (see below)
- place all the public key files in a directory D1 replicated to all hosts
- give each host the secrets keys for members it will host
  - let's say each host calls its secret key dir D2
- on each host run "./main config.out $D1 $D2 $T" where T is desired threshold

Hints for converting config.in to config.out

Preparation: Install GNU CLISP
Step 1: Read and apply hostcomp/hostcomp.lisp to expand config.in
Step 2: Use s2j to convert the expansion to a valid config.out JSON file

Alternatively, hand-edit config.out directly.
